# Calculator Project

**Description:**  
This project is a basic Python calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates the use of functions, user input handling, and basic error checking.

**Features:**  
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., division by zero).  
- Interactive user prompts for operation selection and input numbers.  
- Modular code using functions for clarity and reusability.

**Learning Outcomes / Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Understanding of Python functions and modular programming.  
- Handling user input and converting between data types.  
- Implementing conditional logic for operation selection.  
- Simple error handling in Python.

**Future Improvements / Extensions:**  
- Add support for more complex operations like exponentiation or square roots.  
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter for better user interaction.  
- Maintain a history of calculations.

**Notes for Interview:**  
Be ready to explain:  
- How the program takes user input and decides which operation to perform.  
- How errors (like division by zero) are handled.  
- How you structured the code with functions and why that helps readability and maintenance.
